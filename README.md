# FiveM Pack UI by Hoyame

If you appreciate this project and wish to stay informed about new releases and public updates, please consider following me on GitHub. By doing so, I'll be aware that you have an interest in user interfaces, and I'll strive to share more public updates and projects in the future. Your support is highly valued!

I've decided to publish the work I did for my GTARP server on FiveM two years ago. While digging through my archives, I realized it might be useful for those looking to revamp their server's UI. Please note that this isn't a high-quality release; it's not responsive and is only adapted to a 1920x1080 resolution. At the time, I was in a hurry to get a usable version out and didn't prioritize making it responsive. This release includes only the front-end components, allowing you to customize and enhance it as needed.

As this project is open-source, I encourage you to improve the code, fork the project, and submit pull requests so that everyone can benefit. We're all working towards the same goal, and it's a shame that the UI on many servers hasn't evolved much since my departure. Many servers could be significantly more appealing with further UI development. I hope this project proves useful to you!
